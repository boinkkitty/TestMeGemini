## Model Choice & Cost Comparison

This project currently uses **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** (`gemini-2.5-flash`) for question and quiz generation.
I also considered **OpenAI GPT-4o Mini** (`gpt-4o-mini`) as an alternative. Hereâ€™s a quick comparison:

| Model             | Input Token Price* | Output Token Price* | Max Context | Speed      | Notes                        |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|------------|------------------------------|
| gemini-2.5-flash  | ~$0.35 / 1M       | ~$1.05 / 1M         | 1M tokens   | Very fast  | Lower cost, good for bulk    |
| gpt-4o-mini       | $0.50 / 1M        | $1.50 / 1M          | 128k tokens | Fast       | Slightly higher quality      |

\*Prices as of August 2025. See [OpenAI Pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) and [Gemini Pricing](https://ai.google.dev/pricing).

- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** is currently used for its lower cost and high speed, making it ideal for generating many questions quickly.
- **GPT-4o Mini** offers slightly higher quality and more context, but at a higher price per token.

You can easily switch between models in `backend/api/utils/ai.py` by calling either `call_gemini_model` or `call_gpt_model`.
